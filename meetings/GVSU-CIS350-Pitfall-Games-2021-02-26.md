# Meeting minutes

Team name: Pitfall Games

Members present: Collin Toth, Mary Benton, Victoria tenHaaf, and Benjamin Brown

Date: 02/26/2021

Time: 6:30PM - 6:47PM

Discussion points:

* We need to get our feet wet with the engine; let's just mess around with it before beginning coding work on the project
* If allowed, we could use free assets from the asset store to make development a little quicker
* Since we haven't begun coding work on the project itself, bump to the latest engine LTS release (2019.4.21f1)
* If any of us are more comfortable with one aspect of game design than another, we can split up roles accordingly

Goals for next week (including responsibilities):

* Install Unity LTS release 2019.4.21f1 on all of our machines (all of us)
* Play with Unity over the weekend just to get a feel for how the engine operates (all of us)
* Try to get the Unity project hooked up to our GitHub repository and test commit a text file or some sample code (all of us)
