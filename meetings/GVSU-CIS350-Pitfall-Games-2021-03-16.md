Date: 03/16/2021

Discussion points:

* Prepare for the presentation on Wednesday. Collin will be able to screen share during class and we will talk about what we have done so far (i.e. color change on death).
* Everyone should push what they have done at the end of the day to try and more easily resolve merge conflicts. 
* There has not been any homework posted yet this week, so we can try and work more on the project in the meantime. 

Goals for next week (including responsibilities):

* Try to build a level or two (Collin)
* Work on getting knockback and immunity frames to work to implement health (Benjamin) 
* Work on making an enemy that can interact with the player (Mary)
