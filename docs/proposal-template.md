# Introduction

We will be making a 2D platformer in Unity focused on combat. A 2D platformer was chosen over a 3D one to reduce complexity and provide a less intimidating development process for those of us who are new to Unity. This choice also cuts out the need to work on 3D models and should make developing maps/assets much easier. The game will be based around a central mechanic or mechanics that shape its identity. One of these that we have come up with so far is the idea of changing the playable character's attributes every time they die (fast horizontal speed one life, high jumps another, etc.).

# Anticipated Technologies

- Unity LTS Release 2019.4.19f1 (and therefore C#)
- Image editor to design sprites
- Git/GitHub
- Text editor of choice
- Discord (for communication)

# Method/Approach

(What is your estimated "plan of attack" for developing this project)

# Estimated Timeline

(Figure out what your major milestones for this project will be, including how long you anticipate it *may* take to reach that point)

# Anticipated Problems

There will likely be times in the semester that we cannot all give 100% towards the project, and that is to be expected with any group project (especially given the pandemic). Git should make this a bit easier to work around since work can be completed in parallel and at different times, but it is something to keep in mind. For those of use that aren't familiar with it, learning C# may be a roadblock, but it appears similar enough to Java that a little bit of time should be able to get us acquainted. Getting Unity to cooperate with Git/GitHub may be tricky as well, as Professor Fredericks mentioned in lecture.
