# Introduction

We will be making a 2D platformer in Unity focused on combat. A 2D platformer was chosen over a 3D one to reduce complexity and provide a less intimidating development process for those of us who are new to Unity. This choice also cuts out the need to work on 3D models and should make developing maps/assets much easier. The game will be based around a central mechanic or mechanics that shape its identity. One of these that we have come up with so far is the idea of changing the playable character's attributes every time they die (fast horizontal speed one life, high jumps another, etc.).

We are going to be using Unity LTS Release 2019.4.19f1 to develop the game. The 2D platformer will be combat based with enemies as obstacles for the player. As previously stated, once the player dies in the game from one of the enemies or the level geometry, the playable character's attributes will change. We decided this would be an interesting aspect of the game and would make the gameplay different as the player continues to die. The game will have a playable character that responds to commands from the user. As the user advances through the game, they will complete different levels and the character will evolve as it dies.

# Anticipated Technologies

- Unity LTS Release 2019.4.19f1 (and therefore C#)
- Image editor to design sprites
- Git/GitHub
- Text editor of choice
- Discord (for communication)

# Method/Approach

The team will be meeting weekly or as needed depending on upcoming goals to assign responsibilities and discuss relevant ongoing tasks. These meetings will take place on Discord either in voice or via text depending on availability. Should meeting notes or a to do list be needed, they will be written in Discord and pinned so as to be easy to access and reference. Additionally, this method allows for both synchronous and asynchronous communication on ideas or issues as they arise, resulting in a more flexible approach to organization. 

# Estimated Timeline

Listed dates represent the point at which each milestone should be completed, not started.

- 1 week in - Get everyone up and running with Unity
- 2 weeks in - Get Unity to cooperate with Git/GitHub
- 4 weeks in - Implement playable character and make it move in response to input
- 5 weeks in - Implement basic enemy and make it interact with playable character
- 6.5 weeks in - Complete level geometry for stage(s) and implement level completion
- 8 weeks in - Create/acquire art/music assets for stages/characters
- 9 weeks in - Apply art/music assets to stages/characters
- 9 weeks in - Build and package up final product (imagining this won't take too long)

# Anticipated Problems

There will likely be times in the semester that we cannot all give 100% towards the project, and that is to be expected with any group project (especially given the pandemic). Git should make this a bit easier to work around since work can be completed in parallel and at different times, but it is something to keep in mind. For those of use that aren't familiar with it, learning C# may be a roadblock, but it appears similar enough to Java that a little bit of time should be able to get us acquainted. Getting Unity to cooperate with Git/GitHub may be tricky as well, as Professor Fredericks mentioned in lecture. There could be merge issues where multiple people could be working on the project that bring about conflicts. If this happens we would need to coordinate together to find the best version to use and update it correctly.
